triangles: Set of all triangles within a 4 x 4 matrix with border of 2.

quadrilaterals: Set of all quadrilaterals within a 5 x 5 matrix with border of 2

shapes_A_B_dims_C_D: All shapes of sides A and B. No limit on number of shape sides to include. Dimensions of C and D.
C is the size of the shapes to be fit in (matrix of size C X C) and D is the size of the border.

randomshapes_A_B_dims_C_D_E: A reduced number of shapes of sides A and B. No limit on number of shape sides to include. 
Dimensions of C and D. C is the size of the shapes to be fit in (matrix of size C X C) and D is the size of the border. 
E is the number of shapes to generate (or size of the image set).

one_island: Outputs a set of images such that each image has only one connected island of 1s 
(Diagonals are not connected)

Pmax_ones: Outputs a set of images such that each image has only P or lower percentage of 1s 
Sample input: 60max_ones

unique: Outputs a set of images such that each image is NOT a simple translation of another image 
in the set

"""
pencorr_D: Find the nearest correlation matrix using pencorr, subject to the rank constraint.
Then computes embeddings with D dimensions, then normalize the embeddings before output
Sample input: pencorr_200

dblcorr_D: Eigenvalue correction followed by Pencorr. Will have same performance as pencorr at lower rank constraint
but higher performance at higher rank constraint. Takes longer then pencorr.
Sample input: dblcorr_200
