HI THERE THIS IS JED

IF YOU ARE SEEING THIS WE HAVE ALREADY RETIRED ON MARCH 29 

I heard that you are a year 2 math major so this project should be fine for you
however if you feel that you are lost or that you do not know what to do, it is okay

Just make sure that you have fun and enjoy the learning experience.

PEACE
